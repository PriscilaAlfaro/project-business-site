# Week 3-Technigo Bootcamp 

# Business Site

This weekâ€™s project is to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus is for you to practice what you've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.
Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

This project is about pinting classes, including different sections according to the instructions. The repo was fork from https://github.com/Technigo/project-business-site

## The problem
The project was design according to the inputs provided by teachers. It has 4 main sections: hero image, a form, an accordion and a footer.

Everything was designed in plain Html and CSS without any library. The first step was to build the Html main structure and then populate it with information. The image was found on https://unsplash.com/

The next step was to continue with the CSS with the mobile first approach and responsive design with breakpoints for tablets and desktops. Once I had the main requirements I complimented the project with details in CSS like colors and animations.

Most of the project was built with flexbox, to organice better every section. It also contains javascript in order to obtain the onclick effect on the accordion to hide and show information.
